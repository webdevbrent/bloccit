        we use topic_post_url. 
        This is very important. When we use _path we get a "relative URL", such as "topics/3". 
        This works within the context of the website because the browser already knows the base URL. 
        But when a user sees this email, they won't be in the application and thus won't have the base URL. 
        Therefore, we have to define it. That is what _url does. 
        It generates an "absolute URL", such as "http://myapp.com/topics/3".
    %>
    <%# 
        we also use the anchor: option of the link_to method. This adds custom parameters to our URL. 
        In this case, because we used the keyword anchor the 
        URL will look like: "myapp.com/topics/3/posts/...ts/5#comment-21". 
        This allows us to link the user directly to the comment. 
        Jumping to an anchor is something every browser has supported for a long time. 
        If you provide an id tag after the URL, it will jump to that ID on the page.
